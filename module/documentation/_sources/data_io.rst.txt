**Data I/O**
******************************

Formats
=========================

* Input data: All input data must be provided as CSV-files, except the data given in the 'Timeseries' folder. Data is stored in comma-separated text files.
* Output data: Results and time series can be stored as CSV-file or as HDF5-file as determined in the runlist. HDF5 is strongly recommended for large catchments with many cells and reaches. Data is stored in compressed binary files.

Data structure
=========================

Project
-----------------

The data structure consists of three hierarchical levels. The "Project List (CSV-file)" holds a list with all "Projects" as a well
as information regarding simulations period, number of threads and the hydrological modeling concept. "Projects" are grouped in single folders. Each
folder represents a model run which can be a single agricultural field, a network of river segments or an entire fully distributed catchment. A "Project folder"
contains all input data files, e.g. climate and soil information, crop management and a list of cells, reaches and other spatial units of the catchment.

Time series
--------------

**Cell:**
When using the time series option not all data input data is needed, because all flows 
related to single cells (e.g. an agricultural field, forests) are pre-calculated. The time 
series must be provided in a sub-folder of the project for each cell. The records must include
a value for each time step for groundwater, surface water and drainage flux as well as 
related solute concentrations.

**Reach:**
When using the in stream option only 
water flow in river segments is simulated and related chemical processes.

Input files
=========================

All model runs must be listed in a 'runlist.csv' (or any other filename as defined in the calling scripts), which holds 
information on the file paths, run types, database and solver settings among others. An example of the table is shown below.

RunList
-------------------------------

    :align: center
    :figclass: align-center 

A single model run requires a set of input data, e.g. climate, soil or agricultural management or even observed data for the post-processing methods. 
In total, eight files are needed for model setup and additionally one file for each climate station. Moreover, an observation file is needed for some of 
the post-processing methods. other data may be added as well in relation to coupled models, e.g. in case of drift calculation of SprayDriftList.csv is 
needed.
The spatial locations and model settings of all spatial entities must be defined for cells (e.g. agricultural field - 'CellList.csv'),
reaches (single river segments - 'ReachList.csv') and others (e.g. outlets, deep aquifer - 'CatchmentList.csv') and described in the following paragraphs.

CatchmentList
-------------------------------

SoilList
-------------------------------

Information on soils and climate are defined in the two files 'SoiList.csv' and 'ClimateList.csv'. The latter one is related to a flexible number of climate
stations which are stored in the project folder as well:

ClimateList
-------------------------------

CropMangementList
-------------------------------

The management of cells is defined in the 'CropManagementList.csv'. Currently two takes are supported, namely sowing and pesticide application:

CropCoefficientList
-------------------------------

When using one of the plant growth model options (cmf or macro) a straight forward crop water balance is assessed related
to the approach and parameterisation of 'FOCUS MARCO5.2 <https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/projects/macro-0>`_. Coefficients are available for all FOCUS scenarios:

All information on applied substances is stored in the 'SubstanceList.csv':

When using the model option "xDrift" the drift data must be provided as table:

SprayDriftList

Observation
-------------------------------

Observed data can be used for pre-processing (when creating an areayieldCatchment model) or for post-processing, e.g. to assess performance parameter such as r-square:

Output files
=========================

The results of a simulation are stored in five files with the project ID and an underscore as prefix. The files can be stored as CSV-File or as HDF5-File.
The files are related to an environmental component
