**Regulatory Catchment Model**
******************************

Modern agriculture often relies on the use of pesticides in order to
maintain a high production level. However, a fraction of the pesticide
amount applied to agricultural fields can reach surface waters and
groundwater via a number of different pathways and can cause harmful
effects to the environment. Computer simulations are being frequently applied
in the authorization procedure of pesticides in order to evaluate the 
risk for the environment or in the frame of water stewardship projects. 

Catchment modelling is a higher tier option for ecological risk assessment as stated in the `FOCUS Landscape & Mitigation guidance (2002) <https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/projects/focus-landscape-mitigation>`_.
The EFSA Guidance Document on Aquatic Risk Assessment `(EFSA, 2013) <http://www.efsa.europa.eu/de/efsajournal/pub/3290>`_ indicates a 
key role for effect modelling in future aquatic risk characterization in a tiered risk assessment framework. 
Such approaches require correspondingly adapted exposure tools and scenarios ranging from simple edge-of-field
to spatio-temporally explicit landscape-scale catchment models. These approaches should be sufficiently flexible 
and transparent in order to design lower- and higher-tiers of consistent protection levels.

The newly developed catchment model is a modular, flexible and scalable (in time and space) toolbox in order to provide 
solutions for future regulatory requirements and refinement options in aquatic risk assessment of plant protection products.
The toolbox allows for stepwise adaption of model complexity to address tiered risk assessments. 
The approach is based on the open-source hydrological programming library `CMF (Kraft et al., 2011) <https://philippkraft.github.io/cmf/>`_ . 
The unique advantages of the newly developed approach are as follows:

**Adapting the hydrological model structure within a consistent geospatial catchment discretisation**:
The user has then the oppertunity to select from three different option for running the whole catchment and one option 
to simulate only single cells. This is an unique future of the model, because it provides flexibility in terms of hydrological 
detail and spatial representation of the catchment.

**Integrating 1d models into fully connected catchment scale flow regimes**:
The model allows for the utilisation of timeseries from established 1d models of `FOCUS risk assessment <https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/projects/surface-water>`_, 
e.g. `MACRO <https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/projects/macro-0>`_, `PEARL <https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/projects/pearl>`_ or `PRZM <https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/projects/przmsw>`_, and to connect them in a spatial manner in order to simulate water and solute transport across entire catchments.

**Grouping single areas in catchments on the basis of unique combinations of natural properties**:
In larger catchments environmental data is often similar for single fields (e.g. climate x soil x management). Such fields can be summarized as unique combinations, 
which can be simulated one time by using the '1dField' option and afterwards related to localised cells using within the 'timeseriesCatchment' option.
This approach can save a lot of simulation time, because the complexity of individual setups is reduced, but the spatial discretisation stays in place. 

**Handling data efficient and transparent**:
The user can select between the two formats `CSV <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values>`_ and `HDF5 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format>`_. 
CSV gives the user easy access to modelling data by using a text editor or MS Excel, which is a good choice for small scale / short term analysis. When simulating
larger areas for long time periods disk space and data transfer time could be a limiting factor. HDF provides the ability to create compressed binary files, which reduce
the required disk space in a high extent and can be accessed and processed by specific libraries of scripting programming languages such 
as R (`h5 <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/h5/vignettes/h5-Intro.html>`_) or Python (`h5py <https://www.h5py.org/>`_).

The model is implemented following an object-oriented programming approach using `Python3 <https://www.python.org/>`_. Natural entities and their relation
to each other are defined by a `has-a-relationship <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Has-a>`_. The numerical calculations are done by the CMF library which
is implemented in C++ and makes use of the `CVODE solver <https://computation.llnl.gov/projects/sundials>`_. Model documentation is done by using
`sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_ and model versions are managed by `TortoiseSVN <https://tortoisesvn.net/index.de.html>`_.
When programming the model a focus was on using well established open-source Python packages with a widespread use by science, authorities and industry as 
well as by other third party software in the field of geoanalysis (e.g. `ESRI ArcPy <http://desktop.arcgis.com/de/arcmap/10.3/analyze/arcpy/what-is-arcpy-.htm>`_): 

* Multi-dimensional array processing with `numpy <https://www.numpy.org/>`_, 
* Statistics with `scipy <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/>`_ and  `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_,
* spatial oeprations with `scipy.spatial <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/spatial.html>`_ and `shapely <https://pypi.org/project/Shapely/>`_ as well as
* plotting with `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_.

Example
==================

Drift from agricultural fields to aquatic systems related to plant protection product application is a major 
issue to be addressed in aquatic risk assessment. Using the newly developed catchment model 
the regulatory relevant concentrations in sediment and water assessed. The spatial 
(i.e. size and number of single river segments)  and temporal resolution (hourly) are set by the user 
to match the relevant scale for consecutive aquatic ecotoxicolocial risk assessment. 

The example shows a large scale catchment (ca. 1600 river segments which sum up to 150km) in Belgium with a 
dense river network and an intensive cultivation of pome fruits (purple areas). The case study shows the predicted 
environmental concentration in surface water (PECsw) after an application of a fungicide to all pome fields 
at the beginning of May. The video covers a period of eight days after the application.

Modelling concept
==================

The catchment with all its components, i.e. forests, fields, rivers and urban areas, is divided into a set of cells and river segments which
are represented by a set of natural properties and biophysical processes. The information on the spatial location, extent and land use must 
be obtained from land use cover data from public available resources (e.g. `CORINE Land Cover <https://land.copernicus.eu/pan-european/corine-land-cover>`_ ,
`European catchments and Rivers network system <https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/european-catchments-and-rivers-network>`_) or 
local authorities.

The modelling process starts with an automated connection of cells and river segments (:doc:`Step-by-step user guide </usermanual>`, Flow connections).
Optionally, the catchment can be discretised in smaller units (:doc:`Step-by-step user guide </usermanual>`, Spatial discretisation). The user has then
the opportunity to select from three different option for running the whole catchment and one option to simulate only single cells. This is an unique future 
of the model, because it provides flexibility in terms of hydrological detail and spatial representation of the catchment.

Options (a)-(c) provide the same output for each river segment in the catchment, but differ in the calculation 
method of water flow across land areas:

(a) **completeCatchment:** The entire flow network of the catchment is simulating including river segments and cells. All fluxes are simulated by CMF
on the basis of climate and soil data.

(b) **timeseriesCatchment:** The entire flow network of the catchment is simulating including river segments and cells. The fluxes from single cells
must be provided as time series for surface runoff, drainage flow and groundwater flow. Theses flows can be calculated using the ***1dField** option or by any other 
1D field scale model such as MACRO or PEARL.

(c) **areayieldCatchment:** Only the stream network is simulated. In order to simulate the inflow into each reach, the area weighted inflow
is calculated by multiplying the related catchment area by observed flow. The catchment
area is calculated on the basis on the cumulative areas of cells which are connected to directly or indirectly to the reach.


The last options differs from previous ones:

(d) **1dField:** Only single fields are simulated with a 1D simulation approach. The soil is divided into several layers as well as holds a 
surface, drainage and groundwater flow. This approach is equal to the field representation of completeCatchment, 
but without connecting the cells across the catchment.

The background for using different options is as follows. In larger catchments environmental data is often similar for single fields (e.g. climate x soil x management). 
Such fields can be summarized as unique combinations which can be simulated one time (using '1dField' option and afterwards related to localised cells
using the 'timeserisCatchment' option. This approach can save a lot of simulation time, because the complexity of individual setups is reduced, but
the spatial discretisation stays in place. Moreover, the timeseriesCatchment option allows the utilisation of time series from established 1d models
of FOCUS risk assessment, e.g. MACRO, PEARL or PRZM.

Data structure
-------------------

The data structure consists of three hierarchical levels. The 'runlist' holds a list with all 'projects' as a well
as information regarding simulations period, number of threads and the hydrolocial modelign option. Projects are grouped in single folders. Each
folder represents a model run which can be a single agricultural field, a network of river segments or an entire fully distributed catchment. The folder
contains all input data files, e.g. climate and soil information, crop management and a list of cells, reaches and other spatial units of the catchment.

Pre-processing
-------------------

A set of pre-processing tools are available, e.g. to create a flow network between single cells and river segments.
The algorithm calculates Thiessen-Polygons between all cells in the first step. Adjacent
cells are connected via surface water, drainage and groundwater flow to each other. An iterative adaption
procedure simplifies the number of connections in order to reduce the complexity of the flow network.

  :linenos:

  import LandscapeModel as LM
  from scipy.spatial import Voronoi
  import shapely.geometry
  if __name__ == "__main__":
    # connect fields and river segments
    fieldcon = LM.FieldConnector(fpath="c:/ExampleCatchment/",
                   simplify_connections=4,connection_type="RO_GW")
    fieldcon.makePlot("ExampleCatchment.png",resX=100,resY=100,
