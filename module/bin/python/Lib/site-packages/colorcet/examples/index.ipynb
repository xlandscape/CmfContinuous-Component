    "## Collection of perceptually uniform colormaps\n",
    "\n",
    "[Colorcet](https://github.com/bokeh/colorcet) is a collection of\n",
    "perceptually uniform colormaps for use with Python plotting programs like\n",
    "[bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org),\n",
    "[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org),\n",
    "[holoviews](http://holoviews.org), and\n",
    "[datashader](https://github.com/bokeh/datashader) based on the\n",
    "set of [perceptually uniform colormaps](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03700) created \n",
    "by Peter Kovesi at the Center for Exploration Targeting. See \n",
    "[Getting Started](http://colorcet.pyviz.org/getting_started) for installation info.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "Apart from the four [uniform colormaps now provided with\n",
    "matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/users/colormaps.html), most\n",
    "colormaps shipping with Python plotting programs are highly\n",
    "perceptually nonuniform.  That is, small changes in data values\n",
    "result in large changes in the perceptual appearance of the\n",
    "corresponding colors, or vice versa.  For instance, the popular matplotlib\n",
    "\"hot\" and \"jet\" colormaps have long stretches where the apparent\n",
    "colors change imperceptibly, such as the yellow region in \"hot\" and\n",
    "the cyan/green region in \"jet\":\n",
    "\n",
    "![hot](assets/images/hot.png)    ![jet](assets/images/jet.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When colormaps are used for visualizing scientific datasets, these\n",
    "perceptual nonlinearities can make interpretation of this data very\n",
    "difficult, because false boundaries appear in the data, and genuine\n",
    "boundaries and changes can be obscured.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib now offers a [tool to construct uniform\n",
    "colormaps](https://github.com/matplotlib/viscm), but it doesn't yet\n",
    "allow construction of colormaps like those above.  To address this\n",
    "need, Peter Kovesi at the Center for Exploration\n",
    "Targeting created a set of colormaps that are sampled uniformly in a\n",
    "perceptual color space, using methods he describes in a [paper on\n",
    "arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03700).  For instance, the\n",
    "perceptually uniform versions of the above colormaps are called \"fire\"\n",
    "and \"rainbow\" in this package:\n",
    "\n",
    "![fire](assets/images/fire.png)    ![rainbow](assets/images/rainbow.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You should be able to see the differences right away, revealing more\n",
    "detail, more faithfully than if you use non-uniform maps.  For\n",
    "instance, here is a population-density dataset (from\n",
    "[datashader](https://github.com/bokeh/datashader)) rendered with the\n",
    "original matplotlib \"hot\" colormap:\n",
    "\n",
    "![census_hot](assets/images/census_hot.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "and the same dataset rendered with colorcet's \"fire\" colormap:\n",
    "\n",
    "![census_fire](assets/images/census_fire.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be obvious that the \"hot\" version completely washes out\n",
    "detail at the high end, as if the image is overexposed, while \"fire\"\n",
    "makes detail visible throughout the data range.  Yet the qualitative\n",
    "effect is still roughly similar, allowing \"fire\" to be used in nearly\n",
    "any situation where the original \"hot\" was useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Peter provides [versions of 50 perceptually uniform colormaps for a\n",
    "variety of different plotting programs](http://peterkovesi.com/projects/colourmaps), \n",
    "and this package provides those colormaps ready to use from within Python\n",
    "programs.  The colormaps are all illustrated in an \n",
    "[example notebook](https://colorcet.pyviz.org/) that describes the \n",
    "different types available and allows you to test how perceptually\n",
    "uniform they are on your particular display device.\n",
    "\n",
    "Peter's methods differ from those used in Matplotlib's\n",
    "uniform colormaps (as implemented in their [viscm\n",
    "tool](https://github.com/matplotlib/viscm)), which (apart from using a\n",
    "different color model) are designed to satisfy different constraints.\n",
    "For instance, mpl's colormaps are always perceptually uniform in their\n",
    "monochrome representation, not just their original color\n",
    "representation, and are safe for colorblind viewers, neither of which\n",
    "are necessarily true of these colormaps.  On the other hand, colormaps\n",
    "like \"fire\" above, i.e., a usable perceptually equivalent of\n",
    "matplotlib/matlab's \"hot\", are not obtainable using viscm in any\n",
    "straightforward way, limiting the range of useful colormaps that can be created.\n",
    "In any case, this package focuses on making a set of useful colormaps\n",
    "readily available from within Python programs, rather than providing\n",
    "tools for building novel colormaps, for which see the \n",
