This package provides interactive data visualization tools in the Jupyter
Notebook.

The interactive visualization tool that is provided allows data selection
through HTML widgets and outputs a Vega-lite plot through Altair. In the HTML
widget it is possible to select columns to plot in various encodings. This
widget also supports some basic configuration (i.e., log vs linear scales).
