class theme:

    This is a base class for themes.

    In general, only complete themes should subclass this class.

    Parameters
    -----------
    complete : bool
        Themes that are complete will override any existing themes.
        themes that are not complete (ie. partial) will add to or
        override specific elements of the current theme. e.g::

            theme_gray() + theme_xkcd()

        will be completely determined by :class:`theme_xkcd`, but::

            theme_gray() + theme(axis_text_x=element_text(angle=45))

        will only modify the x-axis text.

    kwargs: dict
        kwargs are themeables. The themeables are elements that
        are subclasses of `themeable`. Many themeables are defined
        using theme elements i.e

            - :class:`element_line`
            - :class:`element_rect`
            - :class:`element_text`

        These simply bind together all the aspects of a themeable
        that can be themed. See
        :class:`~plotnine.themes.themeable.themeable`.

    Notes
    -----
    When subclassing, make sure to call :python:`theme.__init__`.
    After which you can customise :python:`self._rcParams` within
    the ``__init__`` method of the new theme. The ``rcParams``
    should not be modified after that.

        rcParams are used during plotting. Sometimes the same theme can be
        achieved by setting rcParams before plotting or a apply
        after plotting. The choice of how to implement it is is a matter of
        convenience in that case.

        There are certain things can only be themed after plotting. There
        may not be an rcParam to control the theme or the act of plotting
        may cause an entity to come into existence before it can be themed.
