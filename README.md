## About the project
The Landscape Model component encapsulating the CMF Continuous module.  
This is an automatically generated documentation based on the available code and in-line documentation. The current
version of this document is from 2021-09-17.  

### Built with
* Landscape Model core version 1.7
* Regulatory Catchment Model version 8 Aug 2018 (see `\module\documentation` for details)


## Getting Started
The component can be used in any Landscape Model based on core version 1.7 or newer. See the Landscape Model
core's `README` for general tips on how to add a component to a Landscape Model.

### Prerequisites
A model developer that wants to add the `CascadeToxswa` component to a Landscape Model needs to set up the general 
structure for a Landscape Model first. See the Landscape Model core's `README` for details on how to do so.

### Installation
1. Copy the `CascadeToxswa` component into the `model\variant` sub-folder.
2. Make use of the component by including it into the model composition using `module=CmfContinuous` and 
   `class=CmfContinuous`. 


## Usage
The following gives a sample configuration of the `CascadeToxswa` component. See [inputs](#inputs) and 
[outputs](#outputs) for further details on the component's interface.

The currently only allowed value is CVodeKLU.

#### Hydrography
The spatial delineation of the hydrographic features in the simulated landscape. This

consistently for all components of the Landscape Model subdivided into individual segments (*reaches*).

surface.  
`DT50sw` expects its values to be of type `float`.

body surface.

#### Catchment
A file path to a CSV file detailing the hydrographic properties of the entire catchment
depicted by hydrographic the scenario. This file is usually provided by the scenario developer (if
usage of CmfContinuous is supported by the scenario) and is made available as a project macro.  
`Catchment` expects its values to be of type `str`.

#### TimeSeries
The inflows to individual reaches. This includes only flows that do not originate from an
upstream reach (these are modelled by cmf), i.e., lateral inflows. Not every reach has such inflows and
the list of reaches with inflows therefore is a subset of the list of reaches considered by the 
hydrographic scenario.  
`TimeSeries` expects its values to be of type `ndarray`.

### Outputs
#### Reaches
The numerical identifiers of the reaches in the order presented by the `PEC_SW` output.  
Values are expectedly of type `list[int]`.
The values apply to the following scale: `space/reach`.
Values have no physical unit.
#### PEC_SW
The modelled concentration in the water phase.  
Values are expectedly of type `ndarray`.
Value representation is in a 2-dimensional array.
Dimension 1 spans the number of simulated hours as spanned by the [Begin](#Begin) and [End](#end) input.
Dimension 2 spans the number of reaches included in the [Hydrography](#Hydrography) input.
Chunking of the array is for fast retrieval of time series.
Individual array elements have a type of `float`.
The values apply to the following scale: `time/hour, space/base_geometry`.
The default value of the output is `0`.
The physical unit of the values is `mg/mÂ³`.


## Roadmap
The following changes will be part of future `CascadeToxswa` versions:
* z-value precision ([#3](https://gitlab.bayer.com/aqrisk-landscape/cmfcontinuous-component/-/issues/1))
* Deprecation warning ([#2](https://gitlab.bayer.com/aqrisk-landscape/cmfcontinuous-component/-/issues/2))
